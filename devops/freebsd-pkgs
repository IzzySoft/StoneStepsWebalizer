# GCC can be installed on FreeBSD, but v9 and v10 crash when
# building this project, so CLang must be used. 
#
# The pre-installed Clang v10 has a bug around C++ template
# parameter packs following default arguments and fails to
# build this project. This bug was fixed in CLang v11.
#
# Project Makefile uses requires bash and uses GNU syntax.
# After installing these packages a Makefile patch must be
# applied before building binaries.

# build tools
pkg install -y bash gmake llvm11

# dependencies (zlib is already installed)
pkg install -y libgd libmaxminddb db5 googletest
